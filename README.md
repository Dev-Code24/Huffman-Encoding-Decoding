# Huffman-Encoding-Decoding
This is a project for me to learn about lossless file compression using Huffman Encoding/Decoding


```sh
Disclaimer:
The GUI can take up a .txt file with any name
To run the command below:
`java Main`
the input file name must be: input.txt as in the repository
```
## Commands:
#### For running the GUI
```sh
// Open the terminal in the root of the repository then run
java -cp HuffmanGUI
```
#### For running directly through the terminal
```sh
// Open the terminal in the root of the repository then run
cd src && java Main
```
## Demo
##### Using the Main.java file
