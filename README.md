# Huffman-Encoding-Decoding

This is a project for me to learn about lossless file compression using Huffman Encoding/Decoding
The program supports multi-file encoding/decoding at once.

## Commands:

#### For running the GUI

```sh
// Open the terminal in the root of the repository then run
// Following is to run without using the multithreading feature
java -cp src HuffmanGUI

// Following is to run with the multithreading feature
java -cp src_multithreaded HuffmanGUI
```

## Demo
